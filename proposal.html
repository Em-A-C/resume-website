      <h1>Website Proposal:</h1>
      
      <!-- Purpose and Goals -->
      <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
      <p> My purpose in building a resume website is to have a reliable and effective tool that showcases my
        skills, abilities, and achievements to potential employers, clients, and other professionals. By
        presenting my resume/portfolio in a website format, I can demonstrate my skills and abilities in a more
        comprehensive way, which can help me stand out from the competition and gain more opportunities. My hope
        for my live URL is https://www.emilycannon.com. </p>
      <br>
      
      <!-- Target Audience -->
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p> As a future web developer, I envision my resume website as a platform to exhibit my skills and expertise
        to potential future employers and clients. I aim to create a website that is professional and polished
        and highlights my current projects and achievements in a clear and concise manner, with room to share
        future projects and experiences. I would be sharing my website's URL with future potential employers,
        which I hope will provide them with a better understanding of my qualifications and expertise.
        Additionally, I would want to share my URL with fellow professionals in the web development field in the
        future for networking opportunities or potential collaborations on projects. </p>
      <br>
      
      <!-- Competitor Analysis with Examples -->
      <h2>Competitor Analysis with Examples</h2>
      <p> Many people create and use resume websites for a variety of careers. However, in order to stand out
        from the sea of other resume websites, I'll have to make my resume site unique to myself and have my
        projects easily accessible in an aesthetic format. The site will need to be easily navigated with
        the important information presented in an appealing fashion, where it will possibly catch someone's
        interest or attention quickly. </p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <!-- Resume Website Examples 1 -->
          <li> <a href="https://www.wixfresh.com/post/resume-websites" target="_blank"> https://www.wixfresh.com/post/resume-websites </a>: this website lists resume website examples for inspiration (I will list my favorites
            below).
            <ul>
              <!-- List item 1 -->
              <li> <a href="https://www.hi-im-julian.com/" target="_blank"> https://www.hi-im-julian.com/ </a>: I like the creative and humorous layout of the home page. </li>
              
              <!-- List item 2 -->
              <li> <a href="https://www.ximenavengoechea.com/bio" target="_blank"> https://www.ximenavengoechea.com/bio </a>: I like the simplicity of the navigation, and the design is perfectly balanced;
                it's not too busy, but it's not void of personality either. </li>
              
              <!-- List item 3 -->
              <li> <a href="https://www.pascalvangemert.nl/" target="_blank"> https://www.pascalvangemert.nl/ </a>: I like the timeline that is presented on this webpage of this person's skills and
                experiences. </li>
              
              <!-- List item 4 -->
              <li> <a href="https://www.joshuamccartney.com/" target="_blank"> https://www.joshuamccartney.com/ </a>: I like the tile layout of the projects on this website. </li>
              
              <!-- List item 5 -->
              <li> <a href="https://www.kiran.fyi/" target="_blank"> https://www.kiran.fyi/ </a>": This one has a similar tile layout to the last one, but it seems smoother and
                more balanced. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <!-- Resume Website Examples 2 -->
          <li> <a href="https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/inspiration/resume-websites" target="_blank"> https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/inspiration/resume-websites </a>: another website that lists resume website examples (I will list my favorites below).
            <ul>
              <!-- List item 1 -->
              <li> <a href="https://www.thomasgrangeon.com/" target="_blank"> https://www.thomasgrangeon.com/ </a>: I like the idea of linking my LinkedIn with a button on the home page that says
                “Resume,” similar to how this person did so on their website. </li>
              
              <!-- List item 2 -->
              <li> <a href="https://maddieharris.org/#skills" target="_blank"> https://maddieharris.org/#skills </a>: I like the “Skills” section that showcases a list of skills this person has. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      
      <!-- Content Strategy -->
      <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
      <p> The visual content for my resume website will mainly consist of images and links to my own projects, and
        I'll strive to use images that are high-quality and visually appealing that show my best work. These
        images may be graphic design projects I have done or screenshots from webpages I have built; if I
        showcase some of the small webpages I have built, I will include links to them as well. Also, if I end
        up using any GIFs or images from the web, I'll always cite them to give proper credit. </p>
      <br>
      
      <!-- Navigation -->
      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <p> My resume website will contain about five different web pages: the home page, the about page, the
        graphic design project page and the web projects page under "Portfolio", and the contact page. The most
        important information for the viewer, if, for example, they are a potential employer, would be the
        About page, where they could see my experiences, education, etc., and for a potential client, the
        portfolio page would be most important because they could see my past work and decide whether they would
        want to work with me. <br>
        The hierarchy of my website is as follows: </p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <!-- Home Page -->
          <li> Home Page:
            <ul>
              <li> Introduce myself and the purpose of the webpage, and include a “Resume” button under the
                text that opens my LinkedIn page in a new tab. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <!-- About -->
          <li> About:
            <ul>
              <li> Bio: This page will provide more in-depth information (than the home page) about who I
                am and what I do. I may also share my education and experiences (or leave that space for
                that information in the future). I may also include a "Skills" section on this page with
                a list of my existing skills. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <!-- Portfolio -->
          <li> Portfolio:
            <ul>
              <!-- List item 1 -->
              <li> Graphic design projects: I would like to showcase my graphic design projects via a tile
                layout and possibly create each tile where they 'flip over' with a simple cursor hover
                trigger to show a quick description of said projects. </li>
              
              <!-- List item 2 -->
              <li> Web projects: showcase a few of my web projects via links and screenshots and possibly
                include a small description of each project via a dropdown feature. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <!-- Contact -->
          <li> Contact:
            <ul>
              <li> I'd like to create a simple contact form with text input boxes for viewers to type in
                their name, email, and/or phone number and the message they want to send. I may also
                possibly include another link to my LinkedIn as a second line of contact, where the
                viewer of my website could message me there instead. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      
      <!-- Font Families -->
      <h2>Font Families</h2>
      <p> I have chosen Rokkitt for the headings and Roboto for the body of my website. I decided to go for a
        sans-serif font like Roboto for the body as it makes the content more readable. On the other hand, I
        also chose Rokkitt because it is a serif font that creates a nice contrast between the headings and the
        body, making the content more interesting for the viewer. To create some contrast between the level one
        and level two headings, I decided to italicize the level two headings in the same Rokkitt font as the
        level one headings Overall, the combination of these two fonts creates contrast and interest in the
        content while also maintaining good readability. Additionally, I chose these two fonts because Roboto
        was trending on Google Fonts, so I used it for the body. This choice led me to select Rokkitt font for
        the level one and level two headings; I was inspired to choose Rokkitt by a Figma article that displayed
        the best fonts that work well with Roboto. <br>
        These are the resources that have helped me make the best font family choices for my website: </p>
