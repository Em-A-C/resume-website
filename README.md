# resume-website 
### About:
My resume website, which I built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in a web development course I recently took for my degree, showcases my skills and experiences to future employers, peers/co-workers, and clients. So far, it showcases both my web and graphic design projects and lists my current skills. I plan to add to it throughout the rest of college continually and my career as I learn new skills and create better projects.
