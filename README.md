# resume-website 
### About:
My resume website, which I built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, showcases my skills and experiences to future employers, peers/co-workers, and clients. So far, it showcases both my web and graphic design projects and lists my current skills. I plan to continually add to it throughout the rest of college and my career.
